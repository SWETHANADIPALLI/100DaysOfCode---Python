Day 1 of 100DaysOfCode - Python

Required Knowledge/Idea on below Concepts to write the Band Name Generator Program:
print():
•	Used to print something in Output console.
•	Syntax: print(variable or String)
•	Example: 
o	print('swetha') #it prints swetha as it is in the console
o	a=10
print(a) # It prints value 10 in the Output console.
o	print('swetha)#SyntaxError: EOL While scanning String literal
	To resolve this error, mention ‘ at the end of the string
o	      print('Hello Everyone')#IndentationError: Unexpected Indentation before the Error
	To resolve this Error don’t give any space before print statement
•	By default the value for Print statement is new line(\n).
input():
•	Used to take input from the End User
•	Syntax: input() #We can write any text inside parenthesis to make end User to understand what value has to given.
•	Example:
o	a=input('enter your name') #This line means asking end user to give their name
Basic Info About String:
•	String is nothing but collection of characters/alphabets or text.
•	In python, Single character also will be considered as String only.
•	String can be represented either by using single quote(') or double quote(")
•	Examples:
o	s='swetha Nadipalli'
o	s='swetha
   Nadipalli' #SyntaxError: EOL While Scanning String literal
•	If you want to represent String input in next line, then we need to mention backslash('\') so that it will understands like some input in next line also, but the output will be in single line only.
•	Example:
o	s='swetha\
   Nadipalli' #output: swethaNadipalli
•	If you want the output swetha in one line and nadipalli in another line, then need to mention the escape character, where you required new line
•	s='swetha\nNadipalli' #Output: swetha
    Nadipalli
•	If we required to use either ' or " in string itself:
o	using single quote(') then enclose string with double quote
o	using double quote(") then enclose string with single quote
o	using both single quote(') and double quote(") then enclose string with triple quote(‘’’)
o	Example:
	print('What's your pet name') #SyntaxError: Invalid Syntax
•	To resolve this Error enclose string with Double quotes(“)

Variables:
•	Used to store some value, it's nothing but placeholder for a value
Rules for Constructing Variable name:
•	Both upper case (A-Z) and lower case (a-z) alphabets are allowed. 
•	Digits (0-9) are allowed but doesn't start with digit
•	No special characters allowed except underscore(_)
•	blank spaces are not allowed
•	keywords are not allowed
Valid Variable Names:
•	Swetha
•	Swetha123
•	Swetha_Nadipalli
Invalid Variable Names:
•	123Swetha # Invalid because it’s started with digit
•	swetha@123 #Invalid because contains special characters
•	swetha Nadipalli #Invalid because contains blank spaces
•	while #Invalid because it’s a keyword

Example:
•	num1=10
o	Where num1 - variable name and 10 is value stored in variable num1.
•	city='hyd'
o	Where city - variable name and 'hyd' is the value stored in variable city.
Steps to run the program:
•	Download the file main.py
•	open IDLE and then click on file-->open
•	open the downloaded file and then click on run --> run module
Steps to Run the New program:
•	Open IDLE, click on File --> New
•	Write your code and then click on File --> Save or ctrl+s
•	Click on Run --> Run Module
Don't know how to install Python IDLE:
•	Open Google and search python.org.com
•	Select the type of platform and then select the version, click on download
•	Click on downloaded file and make sure to select add to path check box 
•	Note: selecting add to path checkbox - allows you to run your program anywhere.
•	If you forgot to select the checkbox, then add path to your system environment variables.


That’s it for today, Thanks see you tomorrow!
